.SH CONFIGURING HANDLERS
TCMU-backed handlers are typically configured using normal LIO
configuration tools, such as
.BR targetcli .
Part of doing this will be entering a handler-specific configuration
string.
.SS CONFIGURING GLUSTER HANDLER (glfs)
This handler uses the Gluster glfs API to use Gluster as a backstore
for the image file.
.P
Its configuration string is:
.IP "" 4
\fIvolume\fB@\fIhostname\fB/\fIfilename\fR
.br
volume: The volume on the Gluster server
.br
hostname: The server's hostname
.br
filename: The backing file
.SS CONFIGURING QCOW HANDLER (qcow)
This handler supports qcow, qcow2, or raw image file
formats.
.P
Its configuration string is:
.IP "" 4
\fIpath\fR
.br
path: The full path to a file of a supported file format. The file
must already have been created using
.BR qemu-img .
